## Horiseon Webpage Accessibility Code Refactor

I was given the task by a marketing group to refactor code to the Horiseon website. The purpose for this task to improve my knowledge of HTML and CSS to improve the websites accessibility and functionalility. Also, the task enabled me to navigate, use Github.com, and acclimate to Git commands to push and pull from the server to my local system. 

Upon visiting the site, I noticed that the overall presentation of the site was simple and direct. However, the website did not function properly. The 3 navigation links within the header did not work. I pulled the html and css code and noticed an incredible amount of div tags, making the code difficult to read. I used proper semantic tags improving accessibility and functionality.

Being my first project, I've learned the value of productivitity and clean codes. I was able to use the correct semantic tags to eliminate redundant tags, making the code accessible and the website functions properly. Although this task was challenging because of my current lack of knowledge, it was a rewarding feeling to get solutions for my effort.
